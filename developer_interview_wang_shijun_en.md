## Interview

> Could you please introduce yourself ?

I am wangshijun, a full stack JS engineer. Heard blockchain in 2017 and learn blockchain technology through CryptoCurrency courses on Coursera. Write technical articles regularly. You can find me on following channel:

* Author of https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/feweekly and High quality technology [Video lession](http://47.104.23.85/courses)
* Author Minibook http://t.cn/REb5oGv and http://t.cn/RuxYGUZ
* GitHub page：https://github.com/wangshijun ；

>  When did you start learning programming?


Write first code in second year of university, 2007. Renren(Facebook clone in china) is popular and found I can make personal page cool and unique by adding code. So I dived into technology behind it even I never login Renren later. In past 10 years, I wrote CSS, HTML, JS, PHP, and JS. I also developed front-end, backend, supporting system, client. I enjoy coding.

> What programming software do you use every day? Such as IDE, debugger

My favorite tools is changing slowly. Top one is VIM, simple and powerful. I always turn on VIM mode in all modern IDE like VSCode. I use many debugger tools, Charles for networking, Chrome Dev tools for web page, Postman for API. The debugger function in IDE is very powerful now.

> What hardware do you use every day?

Mac Book Pro 15, I really love it since 2013 and recommend it to my friends. A large screen and a mechanical keyboard can make daily life easy. 

> How did you know Mixin Network? from which channel?

I followed Mixin Network since end of 2017.

> Why you wanted to develop this project?

- Software is eating the world, and JS is eating software. More and more developer select JS in recent years. Developer always need an good JS SDK.
- Although there is nodejs library [mixin-node](https://github.com/virushuo/mixin-node), but it did not cover all api of Mixin Network, and code quality can be improved a lot.

> What is the language and frame work used in the project? When did you learn them?

I have used JS for 9 years. 

> Is there any feeling when you build this project?

Porting or developing application on Mixin Network is very easy because Mixin Network did not force me to learn new language or patten.

> Any income or achievement for Mixin Network?

There is no income from [mixin-node-client](https://github.com/wangshijun/mixin-node-client) , but I learn a lot when I design a clear and elegant SDK. I hope more people can understand blockchain and blockchain application. 
> Any suggestions for Mixin Network?
There should be one place to collect community code, 
It should be more easy for developer to contribute code, for new comer to learn knowledge. React Community is a very good example which did very well on helping community.


> What do you think about the future use of digital assets?

Ryan Sean Adams : Software has eaten mail, commerce, maps, servers, taxis, Blockbuster, payments, photos, games, hotels, songs. Money is next on it's list!
