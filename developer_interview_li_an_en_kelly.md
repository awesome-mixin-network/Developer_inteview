Mixin Network has an active developer community, and we invite these developers to talk about their developing stories. This interviewee 's GitHub address is http://github.com/an-lee. 

Mixin: Could you introduce yourself? 
My name is An LI. Civil engineering background, I worked as a structural engineer in the architectural design institute for 5 years. I started studying Ruby last year (2017), a while after, I was switching my career to a programmer and joined an Internet startup. During my spare time, I'd like to create some personal projects., and the most recent one is PRSDigg.com.

Mixin: When did you start learning program? 
I started in early 2017 when I had a full-time job, I learned it off hours. 

Mixin: What programming software do you usually use? For example IDE, debugger. 
My main current work is the web development, and WeChat Mini Program development, the frequently used software are the atom, iTerm, Google Chrome, WeChat Mini Program developer tools, and Dash. 

Mixin: What kind of hardware do you usually use? 
MacBook Pro and Nut R1. 

Mixin: When and where did you hear about Mixin Network? 
I heard about it for the first time at the end of 2017, when there were lots of Mixin invitation links in the moments of WeChat. Later on, I learned that the project PressONE built on Mixin Network, I started keeping an eye on it. 

Mixin: What prompted you to take the time to write this bots? 
The main reason made me switch career from the traditional construction industry to the Internet industry was that I have an intense curiosity about new things that push the development of the world, and I always want to participate in it in some way. Since the Mixin developer documentation was released, I've been trying to make time to study and find what I can do. Until July this year, I spent almost a week of my spare time in poring over documents and related information, and I wrote my own demo project called "the wrong topic this: failed investment" over the weekend. Later, I simply took out some of the code and wrote a Mixin Ruby SDK, which is convenient for my own use. 

Mixin: Since when did you learn and use the current language to develop an app on Mixin network. 
In early July of this year, I wrote the first demo, and in a typhoon day on September, I wrote the second project based on Mixin Network (also based on PRESS.one) named PRSDigg.com. 

Mixin: Do you have any particular feeling in the process of writing these projects? 
It seems that Mixin Network has brought developers closer to the blockchain world. As long as you have a certain understanding of web development, the learning cost of developing Dapp on Mixin Network is truly low. 

Mixin: Any advice for Mixin Network? 
No, but I hope there will be more incentives for developers. 

Mixin: What do you think about the future application scenarios of digital assets? 
Digitizing everything that can be digitized should be the significant trend. The digital world has changed from what used to be called the "virtual world" to an important part of the real world. The application scenarios of digital assets should be more and more extensive. However, I always feel the heart of crossing the river by feeling the stones. 

Mixin: What languages, tools, and books would you recommend to other app developers? 
I'm just a newcomer to the "programmer world," and I'm afraid to recommend a language. I'm still learning new languages by myself. I don't think the language is very important, use the one you're comfortable with. At present, Go, JS, Java, and Python all have SDK, which is very convenient to use. However, I'm still the most comfortable with Ruby On Rails at the moment. Moreover, I don't have any recommendation for tools and books either.
